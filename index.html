<h3>hello world welcome to the wonderful world of BERNADETTE's github website.</h3>
<hr>
I will be the first to admit that i am a beginner at web design and a beginner at using github.  I love to write love and to express myself in many creative ways.
It will be interesting to see how far i go down this journey of a new adventure.  Today is day 3 of a computer programming bootcamp and i am excited.  And really want to make this work!

i will..
<ul>
<li>date when i come one here</li>
<li>Try to keep this updated as much as i can</li>
<li>will list my falls my comebacks and my triumphs</li>
<li>and most importantly i will have fun with this and probably open up personally about my life and my days in this new world (it's a new world to me)</li>
</ul>
